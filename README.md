## **Important Notes**

- Ensure that images are correctly placed in the appropriate folders to avoid broken image links:
  - **`public/images/`** for images referenced by URL paths (e.g., `/images/slide1.jpg`)
  - **`src/assets/images/`** for images imported inside React components.

- If moving images to different folders, be sure to update the import paths accordingly.
